# Sales Data Analisys Python - Escola DNC
First case from my training in Data Analisys with Python - Escola DNC

# Case:
The client requested the following information:

- Number of sales per day
- Number of sales and average price per department
- Average age of customers according to the brand purchased
- What is the average income of customers who purchased in the last month


# Dataset:
1. Sales data:
   Description of sales made over a period of one month
   - Purchase ID
   - Sales channel ID
   - Brand
   - Date
   - Price
   - Price with shipping
   - Department name
   - State
   - Customer LOG

   
3. Customer data:
   Provides more information about customers
   - Customer
   - Age
   - Income


All null values in the 'State' field must be replaced with 'MS'.
It is not acceptable for sales to have the 'Price' field greater than the 'Price with shipping' field; if there is any sale in this case, disregard it.

# Execution:
The Pandas library was used for data processing, and Plotly Express for visualization."
